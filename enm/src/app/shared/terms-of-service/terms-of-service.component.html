            <h2>4. User Accounts</h2>
            <p>To access certain features of our service, you may need to create an account. At the moment we only require from you a username, password, and a secret phrase. We hash your password before storing it on our system. The secret phrase, however, is stored as plain text and we'll use it to verify your identity and restore access to your account in the case you forget your username or password. You are responsible for safeguarding your account. We encourage you to write down your account's credentials somewhere safe and somewhere only you can access.</p>
            <p>If you're unable to access your account, reach out to us via Instagram or send an email to rarelygroovy&#64;gmail.com. To verify your identity and restore access to your account, we'll ask for the secret phrase you provided when you created your account. Please be aware that without this secret phrase, we cannot proceed with re-enabling access to your account. If this happens to you, don't worry - you can always create a new account and continue to enjoy Rarelygroovy! If you lose access to your account and also have an active Rarelygroovy+ subscription don't worry either. We can fix it on our end. Just contact us and we'll be happy to get it sorted out</p>
